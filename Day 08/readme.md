HTML5 Canvas

This challenge is all about learning the fundamentals of canvas. The canvas element helps in making graphics and animations.

This project uses the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface, part of the Canvas API, that provides the 2D rendering context for the drawing surface of a canvas element. It is used for drawing shapes, text, images, and other objects.

We use vaiours methods that are part of the Canvas 2D API, example - beginPath(), moveTo(), lineTo() that help in creating 2D animations. I have added comments in the HTML file for various methods to give an overview of their function.
