    <h3>Psst.. check console</h3>

  <script>

    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];


    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    const team = players;
    team[3] = 'Chico';
    console.log(team, players); 

    //expected output is -
    //team = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Chico'] players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Chico']
    //WHY? because, team is a reference to the original array players and hence changing team[3] to 'Chico' also changes the players[3] to 'Chico'    
    

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead with either slice() or concat() methods.
    
    const team2 = players.slice();     //copies the values from players to team2
    const team3 = [].concat(players);  //this also copies the values from players to team3


    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Andy';   
    console.log(team4, players);   //now, manipulating team4 will not manipulate players, i.e, when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    //or use Array.from() method

    const team5 = Array.from(players);   
    console.log(team5, players);    //again, maniplutaing team5 will not change players

    
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 90
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const human = person;
    human.age = 88;    //changes in human.age also changes person.age, because human is a reference to person and not a copy

    // how do we take a copy instead using object.Assign() ?
    const human2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 20});   //modifying human2 does not modify person


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
