Key Sequence Detection

This challenge is a quick one. The objective is to detect the last keys pressed by a user and check if that matches one of the pre-listed key sequences. This is similar to pressing keys on the keyboard by entering a konami code. The Konami Code or the Contra Code is a cheat code that appears in many video games. In this code, the player has to press a certain sequence of buttons on the game controller to enable a cheat or other effects. This sequence is - "ArrowUp, "ArrowUp", "ArrowDown", "ArrowDown", "ArrowLeft", "ArrowRight", "ArrowLeft", "ArrowRight", "b", "a".

I have given my own twist to this challenge. I have made a pre-list of three secret codes sequences and if the user's input matches any of the three secret codes, a unique message related to that specific keys sequence will be displayed on the console. 

Check out for yourself and activate the secret code works!
