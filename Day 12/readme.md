Key Sequence Detection

This challenge is a quick one. The objective is to detect the Konami code sequence on the console. The Konami Code or the Contra Code is a cheat code that appears in many video games. In this code, the player has to press a certain sequence of buttons on the game controller to enable a cheat or other effects. This sequence is - up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A and sometimes accompanied with Start.

I have given my own twist to this challenge. I have made a pre-list of three secret codes and if the user's input matches any of the specific secret code, a unique message related to the scret code will be displayed on the console. This is work in progress. Check out for yourself which secret code works!
