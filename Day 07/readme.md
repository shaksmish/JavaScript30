Array cardio exercises

This challenge is similar to the Day 4 challenge that uses different array methods to manipulate values in any given array.

For the exercises on Day 7, we use methods such as array.prototype.some(), array.prototype.every(), array.prototype.find(), and array.prototype.findIndex().

Overall, these are very quick and simple exercises. Enjoy!
