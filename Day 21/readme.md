Geolocation based Speedometer and Compass

In this geolocation project, the objective is to not just show the coordinates (i.e. latitude and longitude), but also give a heading (or notification) that describes the direction where someone is heading to. And also make a speedometer that shows speed of the person running. This project uses Xcode which is an iOS simulator to test the code.
