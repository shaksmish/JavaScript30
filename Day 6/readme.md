Type form

In this challenge, we create a simple type form. Here we are using an existing database consisting of information about US cities, states and population density. 

Function - When a user types the name of the city or state in the search box, it should give a drop-down list of suggestions based on the input data. For instance, when a user enters 'Boston', then the suggestions should show city name, state and its population. Or when a user enters 'Ohio', then the suggestions must mention all the cities within the state along with its population density.

That's all!
